# Formatting

We're going to cover all the standard formatting, like *italics*, **bolds**,
`:inline-code` ~~strikethrough~~ and "smart quotes" -- so we can check the
styling in the docs.

- Let's check
- unordered
- lists

1. And let's also check
2. ordered
2. lists

Let's check to make sure that a
#hashtag at the beginning of a line is not a header

---
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

We should also check code block formatting:

    (defn foo [x]
      (+ x 1))

Even within fenced code blocks:

```clojure
(defn foo-1 [x]
  (+ x 1))
```

~~~clojure
(defn foo-2 [x]
  (+ x 1))
~~~

[Inline links](http://example.com) and [reference links][1].

[1]: http://example.com

Extensions like auto-linked URLs (http://example.com) and tabular data:

foo | bar
----|----
 1  |  2
 3  |  4

Definition lists:

foo
: a variable

:bar
: a keyword definition

baz
: a longer description that goes on for several lines, demonstrating that
  terms in a definition list can have definitions that span multiple lines.

We can also use wikilinks to reference existing vars, like [[example/foo]] or
the [[Foop]] protocol, or to reference namespaces, like [`codox.example`](./api/codox/example/).

Any abbreviations, like HTML or HTTP, that have corresponding abbreviations,
will be marked with `<abbr>` tags.

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[HTTP]: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
